Improving SVM model Results through Normalization Techniques
Without normalization SVM model not performed well
After Data Normalization of Min Max Scalar technique the results improved seen in results
Litle more improvment Done by Performing StandardScalara Data normalization technique which further increase the performance of SVM Classifier
Conclusion is StandardScalar Performed well on this data than MinMax Scalar Data Normalization Technique.
